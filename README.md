# Repository Discription

## Inside the coding folders, there are 6 main groups of files:

### 1. **DE files:**
These files perform **Data exploration** for each dataset.

### 2. **Training:**
These files are for models training using golden features (excluding F71).<br>
**Models used:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest.<br>
**Evaluation metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC.

### 3. **Training (F71):**
These files train the models using both golden features and F71 features.<br>
**Models used:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest.<br>
**Evaluation metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC.

### 4. **PCA (Principle Component Analysis):**
These files train AI models using **PCA** method.

### 5. **eva (.csv):**
These files store the results of different evaluation metrics used on different ML models.

### 6. **Other files:**
Files to process **eva** or to assist the project.
