# Repository Discription
## Inside the coding folders, there are 4 main groups of files:
### 1. DE files:
These files perform Data exploration for each dataset.
### 2. Training:
These files are for models training using golden features (excluding F71).
Models used: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest.
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC.
### 3. Training (F71)
These file train the models using both golden features and F71 features.
Models used: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest.
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC.

### 4. PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
These file train AI models using PCA method.
